The following make targets are available:

dev-setup     - Set up the local development environment by installing requirements etc.
compose-conf  - Shows the full docker compose config
run           - Start the container in the foreground
stop          - Stop any running containers
version       - Show the current app version (from VERSION file)
dbshell       - Connects to the DB using pgcli using DB_??? env vars for config info
repl          - Starts a local ipython REPL with the environment set up from .env .env_local
rem-repl      - Starts REPL in container after installing ipython if not already installed
shell         - Runs bash inside the container
show-env      - Shows the full environment the Makefile sees
docs          - Builds the documentation via pydoctor.
image         - Build and push Docker image with versioned tags
release       - Creates a release. In UAT creates an RC release, and a prod release in main.
docker-prune  - Deletes all stopped containers to reclaim space. Will ask for confirmation.
help          - Show this help message.

# Show the help_msg defined above. To break this down for those not 100%
# familiar with Makefile Syntax:
# * The ; after help: allows you to define the recipe inline on the same line.
# * @ suppresses echoing the command before execution (as usual in Make).
# * $(info ...) is a Make built-in function. It is evaluated by Make itself,
#   not by the shell. It prints the message to stdout at parse time, not run time.
# * The : at the end does nothing in the shell â€” it is a shell built-in no-op.
#   It's just there to ensure the line has a command that returns true.
