        }

    Args:

        soc_uid: The ``soc_uid`` from the `SoCEvent` table
        event_count: The number events to return for the start, end and
            transition events.
        raw_dates: If True, dates will be returned as datetime objects. If
            False (the default) dates will be be returned as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
            string

    Yields:
        Each entry is a ``dict`` as shown above.
