#
# Helper script for creating a release in either UAT or production.
#
# This script is meant to be called by the `release` target in the Makefile due
# to the environment already being set up in the make file.
#
# The flow is as follows:
#
# * $ make release
# * This script is called
# * If not on either `main` or `UAT` branch, error exit
# * If any uncommitted changes, error exit
# * If on UAT:
#    * Always RC releases
#    * If not RC already (just merged in from main):
#        * Ask if major or minor should be bumped?
#        * Always zero patch
#        * Zero minor if major is bumped
#        * Set _rc0
#    * Increase rc level
#    * Write to VERSION
#    * Commit change
#    * Add tag
#    * Commit
#    * Push change and tags
#    * If no MR, create one
# * On main:
#    * If not on RC version:
#       * If not a bugfix, remind to merge UAT
#       * Else allow bumping the patch version
#    * Else, drop RC
#    * Write to VERSION
#    * Commit change
#    * Add tag
#    * Commit
#    * Push change and tags
#
# Overrides:
# ----------
# It's possible to test the functionality by settings some overrides. These
# are:
#
# * SKIP_BR=1    - Skip the check for UAT or main branch. Assume UAT unless on main
# * FORCE_MAIN=1 - Always assume main even on UAT. Also helpful with SKIP_BR=1
# * SKIP_UNTRACK=1 - Ignore any untracked files in the repo
# * SKIP_DIRTY=1 - Ignore any tracked changes or uncommited staged files
# * VERSION=x.y.z_rcN - can override the current version number for testing
#
# Example:
#     make release SKIP_BR=1 SKIP_UNTRACK=1 VERSION=1.2.3_rc2 SKIP_DIRTY=1 FORCE_MAIN=1
